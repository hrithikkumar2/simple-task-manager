- Frontend: React.js (for a dynamic and component-based UI)
   Backend: Node.js with Express.js (for API and server-side logic - if needed for persistent storage or external access) OR browser-based LocalStorage only for the most basic version
   Database:  None (if using LocalStorage) / MongoDB (if backend is needed for a database solution).
   State Management:  React Context API / Redux (for managing application state
- especially as the application grows)
   Styling: CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind CSS (for styling the user interface)
