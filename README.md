# Simple Task Manager

This project aims to create a simple, intuitive, and efficient todo application. Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD). Each task should have a title, description, due date (optional), and completion status. The app should provide a clean user interface for easy task management.

**Tech Stack**: Frontend: React.js (for a dynamic and component-based UI)
   Backend: Node.js with Express.js (for API and server-side logic - if needed for persistent storage or external access) OR browser-based LocalStorage only for the most basic version
   Database:  None (if using LocalStorage) / MongoDB (if backend is needed for a database solution).
   State Management:  React Context API / Redux (for managing application state, especially as the application grows)
   Styling: CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind CSS (for styling the user interface)

**Modules**:
- User Interface (UI) Module:
- Task Management Module:
- Data Persistence Module:
- API (Optional) Module:
- Date/Time Utility Module:
